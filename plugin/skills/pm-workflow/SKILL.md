# Product Kit Workflow

You are aware of the Product Kit structured product thinking workflow. When users ask about workflow ordering or what to do next, guide them through this sequence.

## Command Order

The recommended workflow order is:

0. `/product-kit:landscape` — Capture company, team, and domain context (run once, before everything else)
1. `/product-kit:constitution` — Define product principles and values
2. `/product-kit:users` — Define target user personas
3. `/product-kit:problem` — Frame the problem statement
4. `/product-kit:assumptions` — Extract and prioritize assumptions
5. `/product-kit:validate` — Validate assumptions with interviews and surveys
6. `/product-kit:solution` — Brainstorm and evaluate solutions
7. `/product-kit:prioritize` — Score and rank features
8. `/product-kit:spec` — Generate a complete product spec

Utility commands (run anytime):
- `/product-kit:clarify` — Resolve ambiguities across artifacts
- `/product-kit:analyze` — Run a completeness/consistency check
- `/product-kit:bootstrap` — Auto-draft all artifacts from an existing codebase
- `/product-kit:audit` — Compare spec against codebase and surface gaps
- `/product-kit:learn` — Index knowledge directory into a compact summary

## Artifact Dependencies

Each command reads previous artifacts to maintain consistency:

- `landscape` — no dependencies (run first at workspace or project level)
- `constitution` — reads `landscape.md` if it exists
- `users` — reads `landscape.md` and `constitution.md` if they exist
- `problem` — requires `users.md`; reads `landscape.md` if it exists
- `assumptions` — requires `users.md` and `problem.md`; reads `landscape.md` if it exists
- `validate` — requires `assumptions.md`; reads `users.md`, `problem.md`, `landscape.md` if they exist
- `solution` — requires `users.md`, `problem.md`, and `validation.md`; reads `landscape.md` if it exists
- `prioritize` — requires `solution.md`, `users.md`, and `problem.md`; reads `landscape.md` if it exists
- `spec` — requires `users.md`, `problem.md`, and `solution.md`; reads `landscape.md` if it exists

## Artifacts

Commands produce these markdown files in the project root (or in the directory specified by `artifact_dir` in `.productkit/config.json`):
- `landscape.md` — Company, team, and domain landscape
- `constitution.md` — Product principles and values
- `users.md` — Target user personas
- `problem.md` — Problem statement
- `assumptions.md` — Prioritized assumptions
- `validation.md` — Assumption validation results, interview scripts, and survey questions
- `solution.md` — Chosen solution with alternatives considered
- `priorities.md` — Scored and ranked feature list
- `spec.md` — Complete product spec ready for engineering
- `knowledge-index.md` — Summary index of research files in `knowledge/`

## Knowledge Directory

Run `/product-kit:learn` to index the `knowledge/` directory into `knowledge-index.md`. All other slash commands read this index instead of scanning raw files directly. Run `/product-kit:learn` again whenever you add new research files.

## Workspace Support

Projects can live inside a workspace (parent directory with `../.productkit/config.json` containing `"type": "workspace"`). When inside a workspace:
- `landscape.md` at the workspace root provides shared company/domain context
- `knowledge/` at the workspace root provides shared research files (indexed via `/product-kit:learn`)
- All commands automatically detect workspace membership and read both project-level and workspace-level `knowledge-index.md`

## Guidance

- If a user is starting fresh, recommend beginning with `/product-kit:landscape` to front-load company context, then `/product-kit:constitution` or `/product-kit:users`
- If a required artifact is missing, tell the user which command to run first
- If the user seems stuck, suggest `/product-kit:analyze` to assess their progress
- If artifacts seem inconsistent, suggest `/product-kit:clarify`
- For existing projects, suggest `/product-kit:bootstrap` to auto-draft all artifacts from the codebase
- After implementation, suggest `/product-kit:audit` to compare spec against code
